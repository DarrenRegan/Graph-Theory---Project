# Graph-Theory---Project
G00326934 - Graph Theory Project - build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

Examples of Regular Expressions

1. a.b.c   - a single (a) followed by a single (b) followed by a single (c)
2. a.b.c*  - an (a) followed by a (b) followed by zero or more (c's)
3. a|b.c   - an (a), or a (b) followed by a (c)
4. (a|b).c - an (a) or a (b), followed by a (c)
5. 0.0.(0|1)* - all strings of 0's and 1' that begin with two zeros
6. 1* - any number of 1's (including empty string)
